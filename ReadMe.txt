## 15-Piece Puzzle 

# Introduction
This file is my ENPM661 Project 1. The project objective is to solve the 15-piece puzzle using a BFS algorithm that finds the shortest path from the initial state to goal state. The folder contains 5 python scripts, each programmed to solve a different test case and output its respective results. The program uses the following libraries: numpy, copy.


# How to run code
Activate environment that has python3.7 and numpy installed (should also have copy library installed by default) - I use anaconda

Open terminal, navigate to folder where code was unzipped

Enter the following into the command line
>> python3 case#.py   #replace # with 1-5 depending on which test case you want to run

Output will be a txt file with all the states generated by code (states will be in string format)
Last state will be solved puzzle


# Libraries/packages detailed
- numpy.asarray(list) - converts input list to numpy array for processing
- numpy.where(condition) - find index of nparray where condition is met
- deepcopy.copy(arg) - returns a deepcopy of argument as to not modify original argument while passed through function
- list.append(element) - adds element to end of list
- list.pop(0) - returns first element of list #used for queue data structure and FIFO convention
